# Getting & Cleaning Data Week 4 Assignment
This R script works with a Human Activity Recognition database created by the University of California - Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The data comes from experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers who each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using the phone's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, information on activity lwvels was collected. This assignement asked that the data be read into R, and merged into a single dataset from which data means and standard deviations could be extracted.

# Repository Contents
* Codebook.md - contains descriptions of the data used and variables created by during the assignemnt
